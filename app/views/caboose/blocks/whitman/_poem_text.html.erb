<h2>Song of Myself</h2>
<h4>BY WALT WHITMAN</h4>

<div id="verse-1">
    <strong>1</strong><br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I celebrate myself, and sing myself,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And what I assume you shall assume,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I loafe and invite my soul,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    My tongue, every atom of my blood, form&rsquo;d from this soil, this air,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the
    same,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Hoping to cease not till death.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Creeds and schools in abeyance,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Nature without check with original energy.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div id="verse-2">

  <div>
    Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is
    odorless,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I am mad for it to be in contact with me.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The smoke of my own breath,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Echoes, ripples, buzz&rsquo;d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and
    vine,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air
    through my lungs,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color&rsquo;d
    sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The sound of the belch&rsquo;d words of my voice loos&rsquo;d to the eddies of the
    wind,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and
    hill-sides,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and
    meeting the sun.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Have you reckon&rsquo;d a thousand acres much? have you reckon&rsquo;d the earth
    much?<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Have you practis&rsquo;d so long to learn to read?<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns
    left,)<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of
    the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.<br />
  </div>

    I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the
    end,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    There was never any more inception than there is now,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Nor any more youth or age than there is now,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br />

    Always the procreant urge of the world.<br />

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always
    sex,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    To elaborate is no avail, learn&rsquo;d and unlearn&rsquo;d feel that it is so.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the
    beams,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I and this mystery here we stand.<br />

  <div>
    <br />

  <div>
    Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.<br />

  <div>
    Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am silent,
    and go bathe and admire myself.<br />

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than
    the rest.<br />

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I am satisfied&mdash;I see, dance, laugh, sing;<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and
    withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Leaving me baskets cover&rsquo;d with white towels swelling the house with their
    plenty,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    That they turn from gazing after and down the road,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?<br />

    Trippers and askers surround me,<br />

  <div>
    People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in, or
    the nation,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,<br />

  <div>
    The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss or lack of money,
    or depressions or exaltations,<br />

  <div>
    Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful
    events;<br />

  <div>
    Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,<br />

  <div>
    Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.<br />

    Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best,<br />

    Only the lull I like, the hum of your valv&egrave;d voice.<br />

  <div>
    <br />

  <div>
    I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn&rsquo;d over upon me,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript
    heart,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And reach&rsquo;d till you felt my beard, and reach&rsquo;d till you held my
    feet.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument
    of the earth,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and
    lovers,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And that a kelson of the creation is love,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap&rsquo;d stones, elder, mullein and

    A child said <em>What is the grass?</em> fetching it to me with full hands;<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff
    woven.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Bearing the owner&rsquo;s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark,
    and say <em>Whose?</em><br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Growing among black folks as among white,<br />

    Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the

    And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.<br />

  <div>
    Tenderly will I use you curling grass,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their
    mothers&rsquo; laps,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And here you are the mothers&rsquo; laps.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Darker than the colorless beards of old men,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their
    laps.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    What do you think has become of the young and old men?<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And what do you think has become of the women and children?<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    They are alive and well somewhere,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest
    it,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And ceas&rsquo;d the moment life appear&rsquo;d.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />

  <div>
    All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,<br />

  <div>
    For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,<br />

  <div>
    For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the mothers of
    mothers,<br />

  <div>
    For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,<br />

  </div>

  <div>
    She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon
    her voluptuous limbs and reach&rsquo;d to her feet.<br />

    The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And brought water and fill&rsquo;d a tub for his sweated body and bruis&rsquo;d
    feet,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And gave him a room that enter&rsquo;d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean
    clothes,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;<br />

  <div>
    He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass&rsquo;d north,<br />

  <div>
    I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean&rsquo;d in the corner.<br />

    To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks
    cooking my meals,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their
    meals,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a
    death-sentence,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The heave&rsquo;e&rsquo;yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain
    of the anchor-lifters,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and
    hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color&rsquo;d lights,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The steam whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The slow march play&rsquo;d at the head of the association marching two and
    two,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    (They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)<br />

    I hear the violoncello, (&rsquo;tis the young man&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s

  </div>

  <div>
    I hear the key&rsquo;d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,<br />

  <div>
    It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />

    The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess&rsquo;d them,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick&rsquo;d by the indolent waves,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Steep&rsquo;d amid honey&rsquo;d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of

    Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,<br />

  </div>

  <div>
    Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon, flatting the flesh of
    my nose on the thick plate glass,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn&rsquo;d up to the clouds, or down a
    lane or along the beach,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek&rsquo;d bush-boy, (behind me he rides at
    the drape of the day,)<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Far from the settlements studying the print of animals&rsquo; feet, or the moccasin
    print,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Nigh the coffin&rsquo;d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Walking the old hills of Jud&aelig;a with the beautiful gentle God by my side,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty
    thousand miles,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Speeding with tail&rsquo;d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I tread day and night such roads.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And look at quintillions ripen&rsquo;d and look at quintillions green.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    My course runs below the soundings of plummets.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I help myself to material and immaterial,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I anchor my ship for a little while only,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff,
    clinging to topples of brittle and blue.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I ascend to the foretruck,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I take my place late at night in the crow&rsquo;s-nest,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is plain in all
    directions,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my fancies toward
    them,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and
    caution,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin&rsquo;d city,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the
    globe.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    My voice is the wife&rsquo;s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    They fetch my man&rsquo;s body up dripping and drown&rsquo;d.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I understand the large hearts of heroes,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The courage of present times and all times,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death
    chasing it up and down the storm,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and
    faithful of nights,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And chalk&rsquo;d in large letters on a board, <em>Be of good cheer, we will not
    desert you;</em><br />
  </div>

  <div>
    How he follow&rsquo;d with them and tack&rsquo;d with them three days and would not
    give it up,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    How he saved the drifting company at last,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    How the lank loose-gown&rsquo;d women look&rsquo;d when boated from the side of their
    prepared graves,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp&rsquo;d
    unshaved men;<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I am the man, I suffer&rsquo;d, I was there.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The disdain and calmness of martyrs,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The mother of old, condemn&rsquo;d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children
    gazing on,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover&rsquo;d
    with sweat,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous buckshot and the
    bullets,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    All these I feel or am.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn&rsquo;d with the ooze of my
    skin,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I fall on the weeds and stones,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Agonies are one of my changes of garments,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the wounded
    person,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I am the mash&rsquo;d fireman with breast-bone broken,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    They have clear&rsquo;d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their
    fire-caps,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Distant and dead resuscitate,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort&rsquo;s bombardment,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I am there again.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Again the long roll of the drummers,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Again the attacking cannon, mortars,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I take part, I see and hear the whole,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim&rsquo;d shots,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    He gasps through the clot <em>Mind not me&mdash;mind&mdash;the
    entrenchments.</em><br />
  </div>

    Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    (I tell not the fall of Alamo,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    &rsquo;Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young
    men.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Retreating they had form&rsquo;d in a hollow square with their baggage for
    breastworks,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy&rsquo;s, nine times their number, was
    the price they took in advance,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv&rsquo;d writing and seal, gave up
    their arms and march&rsquo;d back prisoners of war.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    They were the glory of the race of rangers,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Not a single one over thirty years of age.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was
    beautiful early summer,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The work commenced about five o&rsquo;clock and was over by eight.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    None obey&rsquo;d the command to kneel,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay
    together,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The maim&rsquo;d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Some half-kill&rsquo;d attempted to crawl away,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    These were despatch&rsquo;d with bayonets or batter&rsquo;d with the blunts of
    muskets,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    A youth not seventeen years old seiz&rsquo;d his assassin till two more came to
    release him,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The three were all torn and cover&rsquo;d with the boy&rsquo;s blood.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    At eleven o&rsquo;clock began the burning of the bodies;<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.<br />
  </div>

    Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?<br />

    Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?<br />

  <div>
    List to the yarn, as my grandmother&rsquo;s father the sailor told it to me.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and
    never will be;<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Along the lower&rsquo;d eve he came horribly raking us.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch&rsquo;d,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    My captain lash&rsquo;d fast with his own hands.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    We had receiv&rsquo;d some eighteen pound shots under the water,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all
    around and blowing up overhead.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Ten o&rsquo;clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five
    feet of water reported,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a
    chance for themselves.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Our frigate takes fire,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The other asks if we demand quarter?<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    If our colors are struck and the fighting done?<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <em>We have not struck,</em> he composedly cries, <em>we have just begun our part of
    the fighting.</em><br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Only three guns are in use,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy&rsquo;s mainmast,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Two well serv&rsquo;d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his
    decks.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Not a moment&rsquo;s cease,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Serene stands the little captain,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have

    Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,<br />

    Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,<br />

  <div>
    A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,<br />

  <div>
    Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore,
    death-messages given in charge to survivors,<br />

  <div>
    The hiss of the surgeon&rsquo;s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,<br />

  <div>
    Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering

    The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?<br />

  <div>

    Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,<br />

    Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,<br />

  <div>
    And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,<br />

    Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,<br />

  <div>
    Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,<br />

  <div>
    Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,<br />

  <div>
    Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of

  <div>
    Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,<br />

  <div>
    Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr&rsquo;d laths, their white foreheads whole

    All forces have been steadily employ&rsquo;d to complete and delight me,<br />

  </div>

  <div>
    <br />

  <div>
    My lovers suffocate me,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my
    head,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Lighting on every moment of my life,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.<br />

    Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!<br />

    Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows after and out of
    itself,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And the dark hush promulges as much as any.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther
    systems.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Outward and outward and forever outward.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />

  <div>
    My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were this moment
    reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long run,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    We should surely bring up again where we now stand,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.<br />

  <div>
    A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span
    or make it impatient,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    They are but parts, any thing is but a part.<br />
  </div>

  <div>

  <div>
    See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,<br />

    Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.<br />

    My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,<br />

  <div>
    No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,<br />

    My left hand hooking you round the waist,<br />

    My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.<br />

    Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,<br />

    You must travel it for yourself.<br />

  <div>
    Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know,<br />

  <div>
    Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.<br />

  <div>
    Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,<br />

  <div>
    Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.<br />

  <div>
    <br />

  <div>
    If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip,<br />

  <div>
    And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,<br />

    For after we start we never lie by again.<br />

    This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look&rsquo;d at the crowded heaven,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And I said to my spirit <em>When we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the
    pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we be fill&rsquo;d and satisfied
    then?</em><br />
  </div>

  <div>
    And my spirit said <em>No, we but level that lift to pass and continue
    beyond.</em><br />

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    You are also asking me questions and I hear you,<br />

    I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.<br />

    Sit a while dear son,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,<br />
  </div>

  <div>
    But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you with a
    good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.<br />

    Long enough have you dream&rsquo;d contemptible dreams,<br />

  <div>
    Now I wash the gum from your eyes,<br />

    Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,<br />
