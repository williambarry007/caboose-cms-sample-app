<p>&ldquo;SOVOStyle can shape attitudes, maintain attitudes in a positive way, and change behavior. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a lot to be said for it. &nbsp;It would be like a motivational speaking at a less conscious level. &nbsp;It would be always there and always operating as motivation every time you look in the mirror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This shirt would remind you of the specific things you need to focus on to succeed. It specifically reminds you of what your plan is &mdash; what you&rsquo;re aspiring to do. It tells you where you want to go &mdash; what your game plan is. Everyone has their &lsquo;cue-word&rsquo; and you could use it in training. The real important thing is that you are wearing it for YOU!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SOVOStyle reinforces your belief system. The visual impact of it reinforces the mindfulness of it and keeps it in front of you&mdash; which is the important thing because it&rsquo;s so easy to get side tracked. When you have your shirt on and you see &lsquo;BELIEVE.&rsquo; or &lsquo;CONQUER.&rsquo; it will invoke the emotion of taking action and reinforce it.&rdquo;</p>
